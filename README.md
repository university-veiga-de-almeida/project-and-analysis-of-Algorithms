 # ORDINATION
**Ordination** is a scholarly work with punctuation, developed with C/C++ language.

# Statement
Change the program ordination.cpp (available in the student's system) and add the Radix Sort ordering method. This should be the 7th method, since there are another six methods previously implemented.

# Rules
**a)** The program should continue to run normally with the six current methods plus Radix Sort.

**b)** The program should present the execution time of Radix Sort, just as it is already done with the other methods of ordering.

**c)** Alter the generate function (responsible for generating the random values ​​of the vectors), to generate numbers in the range of 0 to 100,000,000. This step is important for the implementation of Radix Sort to be feasible.
