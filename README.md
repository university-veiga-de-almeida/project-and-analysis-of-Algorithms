 # INTERSECTION
**Intersection** is a scholarly work with punctuation.

# Statement
Create a program that reads a vector of characters A of size n and another vector of characters B of size m. From these vectors a third vector C of size k must be created with the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B). At the end, vector C must be printed.

# Rules
**a)** The values ​​of n and m must be read from the user.

**b)** A, B and C must be implemented as vectors. Other structures such as lists, trees, stacks, queues, hash tables, etc.

**c)** The vectors A and B can have repeated values.

**d)** The vector C can not be repeated.

**e)** The values ​​of vectors A, B and C can be in any order.

**f)** Upper and lower case letters should be considered equal ('a' = 'A').

**g)** Predefined language functions can not be used to treat vectors (search, pertinence, insertion, exclusion, ordering, etc.).


**h)** The function/intercept method, which calculates C = A ∩ B, must have the following signature:   
```
void intersection(char a[], int n, char b[], int m, char c[], int *k)
```

**i)** The complexity of the function/intercept method must be:

```
O (n), if n> m
O (m), if m> n
```

**j)** The complexity of the program (main function/method) must be:

```
O (n log n), if n> m
O (m log m), if m> n
```

# Examples
**1)**

```
A = { 'E', 'C', 'B', 'J', 'S', 'F', 'C', 'V', 'G' }
B = { 'G', 'C', 'M', 'W', 'L', 'O' }
C = { 'G', 'C' }
```

**2)**
```
A = { 'A', 'T', 'F', 'W', 'C', 'J', 'S', 'U', 'Y' }
B = { 'W', 'K', 'R', 'D', 'Q', 'G', 'W', 'Y' }
C = { 'W' }
```
